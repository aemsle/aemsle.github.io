Escape the UwUverse is the largest scale projects I worked on during my time at university. It was developed for Dare Academy 2021 game design competition hosted by Abertay University. The project took three months to conceptualise and develop. I handled audio implementation, design, music composition, level design and the creation of the "Blu Cow Template" system that most game systems were relient on.
