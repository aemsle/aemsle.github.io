Since December 2022, I have been working as a systems engineer on the [Fable](https://playground-games.com/projects/fable/) team at Playground Games, mainly working with audio.

As a systems engineer, I work on designing and implementing audio systems to improve the quality of the acoustics in the game along with enabling design teams to have higher velocity in their workflows. Due to most my work being within the engine code, I need to write highly performant systems to ensure that we can get the most out of our audio budget.

This has been my job ever since leaving university in the same year.
